This is a chatbot application built using React and Python, with the OpenAI, OpenWeather, and Alpha Advantage APIs for natural language processing, weather information, and stock market data respectively. Both the Python and Node servers are hosted on Heroku, and the backend code is available at https://github.com/Goobber33/Chatbot-Back-End. The application uses OpenAI's powerful language models to provide a conversational interface that can answer a wide range of user queries, and also incorporates weather data from the OpenWeather API and stock market data from the Alpha Advantage API. ☁️📈

## Getting Started 🚀

To get started with this application, you will need to have valid API keys from OpenAI, OpenWeather, and Alpha Advantage. Once you have your API keys, simply clone this repository and install the necessary dependencies using npm and pip.

## Usage 📝

To use the chatbot, simply launch the application and start typing your questions or queries. The chatbot will use OpenAI's API to generate responses in natural language, and can also provide weather information for a specified location using the OpenWeather API and stock market data using the Alpha Advantage API.

## Future Enhancements 🔮

This application is a work in progress, and there are many potential enhancements that could be added in the future. Some possible improvements include:

- Adding support for multiple languages 🌍
- Enhancing the conversational flow of the chatbot 💬
- Integrating with other APIs and services to provide more robust functionality 🛠️
