This is a chatbot application built using React and Python, with the OpenAI, OpenWeather, and Alpha Advantage APIs for natural language processing, weather information, and stock market data respectively. Both the Python and Node servers are hosted on Heroku, and the backend code is available at [GitHub - Chatbot Back-End](https://github.com/Goobber33/Chatbot-Back-End). The application uses OpenAI's powerful language models to provide a conversational interface that can answer a wide range of user queries, and also incorporates weather data from the OpenWeather API and stock market data from the Alpha Advantage API. ‚òÅÔ∏èüìà

## Getting Started üöÄ

To get started with this application, you will need to have valid API keys from OpenAI, OpenWeather, and Alpha Advantage. Once you have your API keys, simply clone this repository and install the necessary dependencies using npm and pip.

## Usage üìù

To use the chatbot, simply launch the application and start typing your questions or queries. The chatbot will use OpenAI's API to generate responses in natural language, and can also provide weather information for a specified location using the OpenWeather API and stock market data using the Alpha Advantage API.

To look up a stock, simply type "Stock: [ticker symbol]" into the chatbox. For example, to look up information on Apple Inc., the user would type "Stock: AAPL". The chatbot will then use the Alpha Advantage API to retrieve stock market data for the specified ticker symbol and provide a response with the relevant information. Note that the ticker symbol should be in all caps.

## Future Enhancements üîÆ

This application is a work in progress, and there are many potential enhancements that could be added in the future. Some possible improvements include:

- Adding support for multiple languages üåç
- Enhancing the conversational flow of the chatbot üí¨
- Integrating with other APIs and services to provide more robust functionality üõ†Ô∏è

## Conclusion üéâ

Overall, I'm thrilled to have had the opportunity to work with OpenAI, OpenWeather, and Alpha Advantage APIs, and I'm excited to continue exploring these technologies in the future. I believe that this chatbot application represents just a small glimpse of what's possible with the power of natural language processing, API integration, and real-time data, and I look forward to seeing what other innovations the future holds.
